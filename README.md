# CO2 Emission Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the **CO2 emissions** of different types of cars based on the **volume** of fuel and **weight** of the vehicle using a regression model. By analyzing the relationship between these independent variables and the target variable (CO2 emission), we can estimate CO2 emission levels for various cars.

The dataset consists of information about car names, models, and their respective volume and weight, providing a comprehensive view for building a predictive regression model.

## About the Dataset
This dataset contains the CO2 emissions of different car models. It includes two key independent variables: **volume** and **weight** of the cars, which can be used to predict the **CO2 emission**. This dataset is perfect for practicing regression techniques, specifically linear regression, to predict a continuous variable.

### Dataset Specifications
- **Car**: Name of the car.
- **Model**: Name of the model of the car.
- **Volume**: Volume of fuel (in cubic centimeters).
- **Weight**: Weight of the car (in kilograms).
- **CO2**: CO2 emitted by the car (in grams per kilometer).

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to:
1. Understand the relationship between the car's volume and weight with its CO2 emissions.
2. Build a **linear regression model** to predict the CO2 emission using volume and weight as independent features.
3. Perform model regularization techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
4. Evaluate the model performance and explore new data predictions using the regression model.

## Techniques Used
- **Linear Regression**: To model the relationship between the independent features and the target variable.
- **Regularization**: Techniques like Ridge or Lasso regularization can be applied to avoid overfitting and improve model generalization.
  
## Visualization
- Scatter plots of CO2 emissions against both volume and weight to understand trends in the data.
- Residual plots to check the accuracy of the predictions.

## Conclusion
This project provides a hands-on approach to predicting CO2 emissions based on a carâ€™s fuel volume and weight. The regression model can help manufacturers or consumers estimate emission levels for various car models, contributing to environmental analysis and decision-making.
